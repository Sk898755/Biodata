<p><h3 style="color:rgba(16, 146, 29, 0.63)"> My Name Is: Sumit Kumar.
I am 18 Years old.
I done nothing great in life.
I want to become a Strategic Investor in life. But I didn't even start prearing for it.</br>
I started playing games from class 10th. And I addicted to FreeFire. By playing games only I got 10th rank in class 10th.</br> 
I selected Science in class 11th. But I didn't stop playing games that's why my rank even gone down.</br>
And in class 12th I got the lowest percentage in my academics life.</br>
For better laerning I joined Aakash-Byju's coaching centre.</br>
And by playing games only my JEE and MHT-CET exams also gone worst.</br>
And even receiving this much failure in academics life by playing games then also I didn't stopped playing games.</br>
That's why I am the worst. I didn't even acquire a skill. But I learned 3 Languages till now English,Hindi and Marathi.</br>
